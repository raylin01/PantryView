# PantryView
## Inspiration
We wanted to help people who are unable to provide for themselves or their families. With this site, they can easily find nearby food pantries. Existing sites are cluttered and hard to use, so we wanted to improve on the user experience.

## What it does
Lists nearby food pantries in the Champaign-Urbana area. Provides information on these locations such as hours, services offered, and contact information. Presents a clean map view for easy browsing and locating nearby food pantries.

## How we built it
We built this site on HTML5/CSS3 for the main structure and Javascript/Jquery for scripting and development.

## Challenges we ran into
There were some issues with styling and content aggregation, as well as dealing with the Maps API and documentation.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating a modern clean application for finding nearby pantries.

## What we learned
We learned more about styling, content aggregation, and how to use HERE Maps API.

## What's next for PantryView
Expand services to outside Champaign-Urbana area and offer more listed services.
